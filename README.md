What- First thing I did was add alt to all image tags. Removed some of the div containters that were placed in there twice . I also removed some of the repeative writing in css due to the fact that alot of the items had the same characteristics. I added some containters to give the reader a better explantation of how the sections are broken down 



Why- The reason I added the alt tag to my images was just in case the viewer is on a browser that is not displaying the image correct they still have visual of what is suppose to be there. I removed some of the double css writing to clean it up. Alot of the description tags the client had was were the same for multiple items so I condense it. The reason I added some containters to the HTML page was to give the next coder a view point of how the page is laid out.

How- Used the Alt tag 
within the CSS file I deleted the 2/3 of the similar tags and combined them together. 

My website is not the way it should be , I have messed something up where it pushed everything to the side and did not align my page again
